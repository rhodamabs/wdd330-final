                When JavaScript runs it creates a global execution context, 
                which is the power to read line by line and store the variables in live memory known as the Global 
                variable Environment.  <br>
                It consists of

                <ol>
                    <li>a thread of execution (parsing of code line after line </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>it is single threaded language meaning it executes one thing at a time</li>
                        <li>it does synchronous execution</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>live memory of variables</li>
                </ol>
	
            The global execution context is the space in which javascript executes the code and store staff in
             memory.Functions are a way of wrapping instructions to be done (invoked) later. Every time we execute 
             a function a new execution context is created in a local variable environment. Javascript keeps a 
             track of functions being called in a stack known as Call stack. Global is always there and any other 
             executions that occur are stacked on top of it as soon as the execution finishes the execution is
              popped out of the stack and execution will return to a stack that is below it. 
              Generalized functions are reusable. Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions 
              as parameters or pass out functions. This is possible because functions in javascript are 
              first-class objects they can
              <ul>
                <li>assigned to variables and properties of other objects</li>
                <li>passed as arguments</li>
                <li>returned as values from other functions./li>
              </ul>
