       <h2>Notes Week 5 Part 1</h2>
       <section>
        <p>
           <ul>
            <li>It is the latest version of hypertext markup language to create web pages.</li>
            <li>It has a large number of new features to the specification</li>
            <li>It has brought together a number of related technologies</li>
            <li>HTML5 specification is separated into modules allowing different features to be developed at different paces and then 
                implemented without having to wait for other features to be completed.</li>
            <li>This means that when a previously unforeseen development occurs, a new module can be created to cater for it.</li>
            <li>HTML5 has a data attribute which is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser.</li>
            <li>These attributes are private to a page, meaning they can not be used by external sources. Their purpose is to be used by Javascript.</li>
            <li>Data attributes are perfect for adding data that can be used as a hook that the program utilizes to access information about a particular element on the page</li>
            <li>The names of the attributes are to be decided by the developer but have to be prefixed with the word data as follows:</li>
           </ul>	
	
             data-powers = 'flight superSpeed' <br>
        	 data-rating = '5'  <br>
        	 data-dropdown data-user = 'DAZ' <br>
        	 data-max-length = '32' <br>

           <ul>
            <li>The information contained in these attributes is used to identify certain elements. The values can also be used to filter different elements.</li>
            <li>Each element has a dataset property that can be used to access any data- attributes it contains</li>
            <li>provide a convenient way of adding data directly into the HTML markup, enabling a richer user experience</li>
           </ul>
        </p>
        <h3><u>HTML5 Web Storage</u></h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
               <li>provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies</li>
               <li>has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity</li>
               <li>is easier to use and makes it perfect for storing information about users, as well as storing application-specific information that can then be used during future sessions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h3><u>The Web Storage API has some crucial differences with cookies:</u></h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Information stored is not shared with the server on every request.</li>
                <li>Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same).</li>
                <li>Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies ( There is no actual limit in the specification, but most browsers have a limit set at 5GB per domain.)</li>
                <li>Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentially makes cookies a better choice for something like showing a popup once a day.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            All browsers that support web storage API, the window object has a 
            localStorage property which is a native object with 
            <ol>
                <li>getItem()</li>
                <li>setItem()</li>
                <li>removeItem()</li>
                <li>clear()</li>
            </ol>
            Web Sttorage APIs provides a useful way of storing various types of information on a user’s computer without the restriction of cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3><u>Geolocation</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>to obtain the geographical position of the device</li>
                <li>geolocation is a property of the navigator object it has a getCurrentPosition which returns a position object.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
            <h4>The position object has</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>position.speed property returns the ground speed of the device in meters per second.</li>
                <li>position.altitude property returns an estimate of the device’s altitude in meters above the WGS84 ellipsoid, which is a standard measurement for the center of the Earth.</li>
                <li>position.heading property returns the direction the device is moving in. This is measured as a bearing in degrees, clockwise from North.</li>
                <li>position.timestamp property returns the time that the position information was recorded.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>	
         <h3><u>  Web Workers</u></h3>
         <p>
            <ul>
                <li>allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript.</li>
                <li>Start by creating new worker</li>
            </ul>
            const worker = new Worker('task.js');
            <ol>
                <li>It has a postMessage() menthod</li>
                <li>Terminate() and close method. </li>
                <li>A this keyword is used to refer to the worker</li>
            </ol>
         </p>	
            <h4>Types of web workers</h4>

                    <li>This means that a connection is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are received.</li>
                </ol>
