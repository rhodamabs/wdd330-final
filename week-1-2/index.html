                JavaScript supports an object-oriented programming style of programming. 
                It separates the code into objects that have properties and methods.
                The advantage of this style of language writing is that you can keep related pieces of code
                encapsulated in objects that maintain state throughout the lifecycle of the program. 
                We can reuse objects and modify them as required. OOP language is used to model representations
                of objects in the real world.The three main concepts are encapsulation, polymorphism, 
                and inheritance.
                <br><br>
                We can create objects literary, using a constructor function, object.create a method, or using classes.
                After literally creating an object we can use the object.create a method to create more objects while the
                original objects act as a blueprint for new objects. The constructor function works the same way as the
                class. We use the new operator to create instances of the objects.Objects can be queried to check 
                their properties and constructor information.
                <br><br>
                Encapsulation is the process of hiding information about our objects to implement functionality without 
                the rest of the world knowing how it is done. Users only access essential functionalities. 
                With polymorphism, our objects can share some methods and properties and allow objects to override the 
                methods and properties to more specific implementations.  Inheritance allows the instances to have the 
                properties and methods of their constructor. This reduces coding time. 
                <br><br>
                The recommended way of creating objects now is using the new ES6 classes. Static methods are for 
                the class only not its instance, the way we can have private and public methods. Prototyping allows 
                instances downstream to inherit great great great constructor’s methods and properties.
                <br><br>
                This is a keyword that refers to the object the constructor returns. We can use the keyword to set the 
                returned object’s methods and properties
