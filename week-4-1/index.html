            <h3><u>JavaScript Functions</u></h3>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>javascript functions are first-class objects because they can be passed around like any other values.</li>
                    <li>They have properties and methods</li>
                    <li>They can be passed as parameters to other functions and can be returned by other functions.</li>
                    <li>They are a flexible tool to work with.</li>
                </ol>
                Functions have a length property that returns the number of parameters the function has. 
                They also have call() and apply() methods. These two works the same way, the difference is in 
                the way the arguments are passed. For apply() the arguments are passed as an array regardless of 
                the number of arguments of the function. They can be used to set the value of this inside a 
                function to an object that is provided as the first argument. <br><br>
                I can create custom properties for functions.
                For example, adding the description property that explains what the function does.
            </p>
            <h3><u>Memoization</u></h3>
                <p>
                   A useful feature when working with functions that take some time to compute. 
                   The result can be saved in a catch property to be returned whenever the same argument is
                   used again. Example of storing a result in a catch below. <br><br>
                   function square(x){ <br>
                    square.cache = square.cache || {}; <br>
                    square.cache[x] = x*x;  <br>
                }    return square.cache[x]}
                </p>
        </section> 
        <h2><u>Types of functions we have in JavaScript</u></h2> 
        <section>
            <h3><u>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</u></h3>
            <p>
                -	Anonymous  function that invoked as soon as they are invoked <br>
                -	This is achieved by adding () at the end of the function definition. <br>
                -	The function also has to be made into an expression, which is done by
                     placing the whole declaration inside parentheses, as in this example: <br><br>
                     (function(){ <br>
                         const temp = 'World'; <br>
                         console.log(`Hello ${temp}`); <br>
                        })(); <br><br>
                
                -	Useful for performing tasks and keeping the variables wrapped within the scope of the function. <br>
                -	The global namespace while have fewer variable names polluting it. <br>
                -	IIFE functions are useful when working with temporal variables.
                 This reduces errors because the variable exists only while the IIFE function is invoked. <br>
                -	IIFE can be used for initializing that is run once and will not be reused again. <br>
                -	We can use IIFE to enforce strict mode and avoid sloppy coding practices. <br>

                function() {  <br>
                      'use strict'; <br>
                        // All your code would go inside this function br
                        })(); <br>

                -	We can use IIFE functions to enclose code blocks inside their private scopes so they wonâ€™t 
                interfere with other parts of the program. <br>
                -	This allows us to add and remove code separately like in the example below. <br>

                function() {   <br>
                     // block A    const name = 'Block A';  <br>
                       console.log(`Hello from ${name}`);   <br>
                     }()); <br>
                (function() {   <br>
                     // block B    const name = 'Block B';  <br>
                       console.log(`Hello from ${name}`); <br>
                    }()); <br>
                -	We can use this approach for testing purposes
            </p>
            <h3><u>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves</u></h3>
            <p>
                -	In JavaScript functions call, define and redefine themselves. <br>
                -	This is achieved by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that has 
                the same name as the function like an example below: <br>
                function party(){   <br>
                      console.log('Wow this is amazing!');  <br>
                      party = function(){   <br>
                          console.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');  <br>
                                  }} <br>
            </p>
            <h3><u>Recursive Functions</u></h3>
            <p>
                -	functions that invoke until a certain condition is met. <br>
                -	Useful when there is some iteration involved.
            </p>
            <h3><u>Callbacks types</u></h3>
            <p>
                -	These are functions passed to other functions as arguments and then 
                invoked inside the function they are passed to. <br>
                -	They are used to facilitate event-driven asynchronous programming. <br>
                -	Allows the program to run than wait for certain events to occur. <br>
                -	Callback functions returns other functions. 
            </p>
            <h3><u>Promises</u></h3>
            <p>
                -	Represent the future result of an asynchronous operation, perform the same operations 
                as callbacks but simplify the process and avoid convoluted code from using multiple callbacks. <br>
                -	They can be chained using the .then method <br><br>
                -	login(userName) <br>
                .then(user => <br>
                getPlayerInfo(user.id)) <br>
                 .then(info => <br>
                 loadGame(info)) <br>
                 .catch( throw error)
            <h3><u>Async Functions</u></h3>
            <p>
                -	functions are preceded by the async keyword and allow you to write asynchronous code as 
                if it was synchronous. <br>
                -	achieved by using the await operator before an asynchronous function. <br>
                -	wrap the return value of the function in a promise that can then be assigned to a variable. 
                The next line of code is not executed until the promise is resolved. 
            </p>
            <h3>CSS3 Transform and Transition</h3>
            <p>
                -	CSS3 can now do more than change appearance. <br> 
                -	It can tilt, scale, move, and flip elements
            </p>
            <h3><u>Transform properties</u></h3>
             <p>   -	Translate <br>
                o	Moves elements in all directions (left, right. up and down); <br>

                -	Rotate <br>
                o	Rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle <br>
                -	Scale br
                o	Scale an element by defined factors horizontally and then vertically <br>
                -	Skew <br>
                o	Specifies skews along the x and y-axis. 
             </p>
                <h3><u>Transition</u></h3>
                -	Allows values of CSS properties to over time. <br>
                -	Has the following properties <br>

                transition-property <br>
                -	defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for 
                all properties being the default.	<br>
                transition-duration <br>
                -	sets how long the transition will take: <br>
                 the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state.
                 <br> transition-timing-function <br>
                transition-delay <br>
                -	lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail.
            </p>
                <h3><u>Animations</u></h3>
                <p>
                -	animate elements over time; <br> 
                -	use the @keyframes rule <br>
                <h4><u>Animation Properties </u></h4>
                -	animation-name <br>
                -	animation-duration <br>
                -	animation-timing-function <br>
                -	animation-iteration-count <br>
                -	animation-direction <br>
                -	animation-fill-mode <br>
                -	animation-play-state <br>
