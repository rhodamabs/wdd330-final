            <h2>Notes Week 1 Part One</h2>  
            <p>
                I will work with others in a team. It is an important skill I should develop because it is a required skill by employers. 
                Working with others is not always easy. Schedules can conflict, some members may not participate, unclear structure of the group,
                and different levels of understanding of concepts at hand. Communicating with each other well will help the team function effectively. 
                We are going to use teams to communicate with each other as a group.
                I think everyone has joined the group so far. We will use Trello and well as git hub platform for collaborating on our asynchronous work.
                I should be an active participant and communicate well with others about what I have done, what I plan to do as well where I need help.
            <br><br>
                The front-end development workflow is complicated.
                A project may consist of many types of files and libraries. We are going to use the npm as a package and task manager.
                Snowpack will be the bundler. I have followed all the instructions on the course setup activity.
            <br><br>
                Git hub is a platform I will use with my teammates to collaborate on our project. 
                It allows us to share code and publish websites that host git repositories. 
                Git is a version control we will use to track files and modifications we will make as a team. 
                We will be using the terminal to run git. It is important that I know how to use the git commands to create 
                and navigate through the files, on my local machine, and on GitHub. 
                I should be able to merge files on my machine and on GitHub. 
                When I make changes to files on either local repo, I should use my terminal to add them to the staging area, 
                commit them with a message that explains the changes I have made and push them on the remote repo.
                 I should log the changes I am making. Because I am in a team I should pull from remote and merge the changes others
                  have made with my local repo. I will create my own branch that I will work on and merge the changes as I collaborate 
                  with others.
