            <h3><u>Window Object</u></h3>
            <p>
                A window object is a global JavaScript object that represents the browser window that contains the 
                web page. Browser Object Model (BOM) is a collection of properties and methods about the browser 
                and computer screen. BOM enables us to query information about the browser being used, the screen 
                size it is viewed in, previously visited pages, and many more. Several properties and methods are 
                supported by all major browsers. These methods are available through the window object. Every 
                browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object. Other javascript environments 
                have a global object instead of a window object.
                <br><br>
                We do not need to use var, let, or const to declare global variables. These variables are 
                properties of the global object (window object). The variables can do not need to refer to the 
                window object when using them. ParseInt() and isNaN(), are global properties, so they are methods 
                of a window object.
            </p>
            <h3><u>Dialogs</u> </h3>
            <p>
                These functions produce dialogues in the browsers. They all pause the execution of a program and 
                should be used wisely.  Alert displays a message in a dialog box, confirm will display a 
                confirmation dialog and a prompt request to a user for information.
            </p>
            <h3><u>Browser Information Properties</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Navigator – display information about the browser being used using the userAgent.</li>
                <li>Location – has information about the current URL of the current page.
                    The href property returns the URL string.</li>
                <li>Browser history used to access information about previously visited sites.</li>
                <li>Document. write not encouraged archaic practice of writing an already loaded page</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I read about templates but need more information to fully understand them.
                 I understand that we can use the HTML tag template to create code snippets that will not be 
                 loaded when the browser loads. These can be dynamically populated when needed using javascript. 
                 They are useful and allow reusability of code, lessen coding time and allow many pages to use the 
                 same snippet.
