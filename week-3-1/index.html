        <section>
            <h3><u>Ajax</u></h3>
            <p>
                Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server and 
                dynamically update web pages without reloading. Allows data to be sent and received at the 
                background. Web pages will update in response to user events while the rest of the program 
                continue to run. Ajax stands for asynchronous JavaScript XML. Asynchronous meaning the program 
                does wait for response to. It continues to run waiting for an event to fire when response is 
                received. JavaScript send and receive data allowing updating of content in real-time.   
            </p>
            <h3><u>Same -origin policy</u></h3>
            <p>
                Browsers have same origin policy which blocks all requests from a domain that is different from 
                the page making the request. The purpose is to stop any malicious JavaScript being run from an 
                external source. Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) provides a solution to this problem.
            </p>
            <h3><u>APIS</u></h3>
            <p>
                Application programming interface is a collection of methods that allow external access to another 
                program or service. We have to enable CORS to access information from an API and sometimes authentication 
                is required.
            </p>
            <h3><u>The Fetch API</u></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>a living standard for requesting and sending data asynchronously across a network.</li>
                    <li>uses promises to avoid callback hell, and also streamlines a number of concepts that had
                        become cumbersome when using the XMLHttpRequest object</li>
                </ul>
          
            <p>
                A fetch() takes the URL argument. <br>
                fetch('https://example.com/data') <br>
                .then( // code that handles the response )  <br>
                .catch( // code that runs if the server returns an error )  <br>
                Response has a ok and status properties <br>
                const url = 'https:example.com/data'; <br><br>
                
                fetch(url) <br>
                .then((response) => { <br>
                    if(response.ok) { <br>
                        return response; <br>
                    } <br>
                    throw Error(response.statusText); <br>
                }) <br>
                .then( response => // do something with response ) <br>
                .catch( error => console.log('There was an error!') )  <br>
                Redirect () used to redirect to another URLconst url = 'https:example.com/data'; <br> <br>
                
                fetch(url) <br>
                .then((response) => { <br>
                    if(response.ok) { <br>
                        return response; <br>
                    } <br>
                    throw Error(response.statusText); <br>
                }) <br>
                .then( response => // do something with response )  <br>
                .catch( error => console.log('There was an error!') ) <br>
               
                Text() takes a stream of text from the response, reads it to completion and then returns
                 a promise that resolves to a USV String object that can be treated as a string in JavaScript.
                fetch(url) <br>
                .then( response => response.text() ); // transforms the text stream into a JavaScript string <br>
                .then( text => console.log(text) ) <br>
                .catch( error => console.log('There was an error: ', error)) <br>
                Blob() used to read a file of raw data, such as an image or a spreadsheet
                fetch(url)
                .then( response  <br>
                => response.blob() ); // transforms the data into a blob object <br>
                .then( blob => console.log(blob.type) ) <br>
                .catch( error => console.log('There was an error: ', error)) <br>
                Json() gommon methodthod of formatting data. <br><br>
                
                Hypertext Transfer Protocol <br><br>
                
                GET requests to retrieve resources <br><br>
                
                POST requests, usually used to create a resource but can actually perform any task <br><br>
                
                PUT requests to upsert, which means insert a resource or update it entirely <br><br>
                
                PATCH requests to make partial updates to a resource <br><br>
                
                DELETE requests to delete a resources
