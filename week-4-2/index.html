        <section>
            <p>
                <h3><u>JSON WEB TOKENS</u></h3>

                -	JWT (JASON Web Tokens) is a standard that defines a compact, self-contained way for securely 
                transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. <br>
                -	Compact because of size, it can be transmitted through URL, POST parameter, or HTTP header <br>
                -	Self-contained because the payload contains all the required information about the user, 
                avoiding database requiring more than once. <br>
                -	The information can be verified as well as trusted because it is digitally signed with a 
                secret or a private/public key pair using RSA. 
            </p>
            <h3><u>USES of JWT</u></h3>
            <p>
                -	Useful to authenticate users according to their token rights and privileges <br>
                -	A good way of transmitting data because the sender can be verified to confirm who they are, 
                data can also be verified if it did not change
            </p>
            <h3><u>TOKEN STRUCTURE</u></h3>
            <p>
                <h4>Header</h4>
                Has two parts, the token and the hashing algorithm <br>
                { <br>
                    -	  'alg': 'HS256', <br>
                    -	  'typ': 'JWT' <br>
                    -	} <br>
                    -	this is encoded using Base64URL encoding. <br>
                <h4>Payload</h4>   
                Contains the claims which are statements about the entity (USER) and additional data. <br>
                -	Reserved claims: These are a set of predefined claims, which are not mandatory but recommended,
                 thought to provide a set of useful, interoperable claims. Some of them are: iss (issuer), 
                 exp (expiration time), sub (subject), aud (audience), among others. <br>
                -	Public claims: These can be defined at will by those using JWTs. But to avoid collisions they 
                should be defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or be defined as a URI that contains a 
                collision resistant namespace. <br>
                -	Private claims: These are the custom claims created to share information between parties that 
                agree on using them. <br>
                -	{ <br>
                -	  'sub': '1234567890', <br>
                -	  'name': 'John Doe', <br>
                -	  'admin': true <br>
                -	} <br>
                -	this is encoded using Base64URL encoding. <br>
                -	Signature <br>
                -	To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, 
                a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that. <br>
                -	HMACSHA256( <br>
                -	  base64UrlEncode(header) + '.' + <br>
                -	  base64UrlEncode(payload), <br>
                -	  secret) <br>
                -	} <br>
                -	this is encoded using Base64URL encoding. <br>

                -	The token is then all three put together separated by dot. <br>

            </p>

            <h3><u>HOW JWT WORK</u></h3>
            <p>
                -	When a user logins successfully a JWT is returned, it should not be kept longer than is necessary for security reasons <br>
                -	When a user accesses a protected server, a JWT is sent in the Authorization header using bearer schema. <br>
                 The server uses the information to verify the user without the need to query the database once more. <br>
                -	This allows to fully rely on data APIs that are stateless and even make requests to downstream services. 
                It doesn’t matter which domains are serving your APIs, as Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) won’t be an issue as
                 it doesn’t use cookies
            </p>
            <h3><u>DEVELOP, DEBUG, LEARN? (Chris Heilmann)</u></h3>
            <p>
                -	I learnt that I should not be caught up in the rush of developing new things. <br>
                -	I should not focus on the wrong things but consider the experience of the end user. <br>
                -	I should take not of the application’s accessibility, security, performance and may other important aspects
                 that provides a great experience for those that will use the app. <br>
                -	I should not fall in the trap of depending on different platforms and lose the opportunity to grow. <br>
                -	Now that there are so many tools available. I should make use of them to make myself a better programmer.  <br>
                -	I can use these tools to learn , debug and develop great applications <br>
