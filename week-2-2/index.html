            <h3>Templating</h3>
            <p>
                Templates make it easy to create reusable code. Templating is big on the web and most sites do 
                server-side templating. This is achieved by using web components or application frameworks. It 
                provides an easy way of defining reusable fragments of HTML that can be manipulated the same you 
                would the contents of a document itself.
                <br><br>
                The contents of a template get parsed like regular HTML. The differences between the two are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Contents of a template are not rendered </li>
                    <li>Scripts inside it won’t run</li>
                    <li>Tags will not be evaluated</li>
                    <li>It will not use external resources</li>	
                </ol>
                Content is a powerful property. DocumentFragment instances provide an API for manipulating 
                It (content) like a global document. Inserting DocumentFragment into the DOM is faster than 
                manipulating elements’ innerHTML property because the DOM structure already exist. We use 
                templates to into the DOM. We make use of the clone method and set it to true. Templates are 
                widely supported.
                <br><br>
                Single Page Applications enable users to get content in response to navigation without making 
                a request to the server for new HTML. They use the window. Location method and rely on a router.
                <br><br>
                Errors and bugs are a way of life in programming. It is important to do all you can to minimize 
                or find them early and deal with them. There errors that happen when something goes wrong. Errors 
                that return a value, these create stack traces. There are also errors that are not enough to make 
                a program crash. It is very important to test and debug because wrong information is misleading.
                There are many tools we can use. These are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Using strict mode</li>
                    <li>Linting tools</li>
                    <li>Feature detectors</li>
                    <li>Debugging tools</li>
                    <li>Console</li>
                    <li>Alerts</li>
                    <li>Throwing exception</li>
                    <li>Using browser etc</li>
                </ol>
